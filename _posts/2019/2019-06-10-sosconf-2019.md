Student Open Source Conference (sosconf) is the very first student-held, student-centered international conference focusing on open source. It will be a great opportunity for students around the world to gather, connect and learn from each other. For companies and organizations, it will be a chance to show their support for open source and to meet an extremely diverse group of students. This year, the conference will be held at University of Southern California in Los Angeles on September 1, with a welcome banquet on the previous evening. Students of any education levels around the world are welcome to participate as audience, volunteers or speakers, with an opportunity to obtain travel reimbursement.

Open-source software is a piece of software whose source code is distributed, modified and reused by the public with a few restrictions. The emphasis of open-source development on freedom, collaboration and community appeals to Silicon Valley companies and student organizations alike.

“sosconf is brought to students, by students,” said Ivan, an undergraduate student at University of Southern California (a.k.a. USC) and the Convenor of sosconf 2019 Committee. The conference is organized by an international community of students, who have also contributed to events such as GNOME.Asia, FOSSASIA, PyCon and IBM Developer Day.

On the other hand, only students are eligible to be speakers and volunteers. All speakers and volunteers with outstanding work will receive travel reimbursement. The sosconf 2019 Committee is dedicated to making the conference accessible to all students in the world.

Non-students can also participate in different ways. Our supporters and supervisors include active community members and professors from colleges in multiple countries.

Today’s students have diverse interests in the most exciting technology areas where evolution is a constant. “Many USC students I know are developing their own interests in very specific dimensions,” said Ivan, “and that deserves more attention.” The conference will be divided into several tracks each dedicated to a technology domain, such as Machine Learning, Operating Systems, Information Security, Decentralization, and Arts and Design. There will also be a “Women in Open Source” track, and a “Communities” track featuring student contributors in renowned open source communities.

The conference will be more than talks and networking. It will be a template for future sosconf’s organized by students in different places in the world. The team is developing open-source tools such as a user system and a ticket system, as well as Hexang.org, an “open-source lifestyle platform”, for project management. Other resources will also be available to student communities around the world for reference and “forking”.

“The conference itself is an open-source project,” said Ivan, “and we welcome students and sponsors who identify with our goals to join us to make this happen.” Contact information and event details are now available on sosconf’s official website, [https://2019.sosconf.org](https://2019.sosconf.org).
